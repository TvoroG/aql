This directory holds a test for using Lua to call a module written in C.
Please ensure that gcc, wget are installed.

To run the example, run the commands:

> sudo ./build.sh
> aql -c "execute use_power.call_go(123) on test where pk='x'"

SUCCESS: 15129


The build.sh will:
--  build the power.so
--  register the power.so and use_power.lua files with the server.

The asql call will:
--  initiate a call to use_power.call_go with 123 as its argument.
    use_power.call_go imports power.so to calculate the square of 123.
